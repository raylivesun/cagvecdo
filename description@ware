Okay, the word "description" itself refers to:

1.  **A spoken or written account** of a person, object, event, place, or concept.
2.  **The act of describing** something by detailing its characteristics, qualities, features, or events.

**Key aspects of a description often include:**

*   **Sensory Details:** Using sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch to create a vivid picture.
*   **Specific Details:** Providing concrete information rather than vague generalities.
*   **Figurative Language:** Employing tools like similes, metaphors, and personification to make the description more engaging or understandable.
*   **Organization:** Presenting details in a logical order (e.g., spatially, chronologically, by importance).
*   **Purpose:** The goal of the description (e.g., to inform, persuade, entertain, evoke emotion).

**To give you a more useful answer, could you clarify what you need a description *of*, or what context you're asking about? For example, are you looking for:**

*   The **definition** of the word "description" (which I've provided above)?
*   Tips on **how to write** a good description?
*   An example **description of something specific** (like a sunset, a car, a feeling, a process)?
*   A description for a **particular purpose** (like a product description, a character description, a job description)?
